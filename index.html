		This is a website about pendulums, their uses, and a recent experiment the creators of this website, Thomas Isernhagen, Emmanuel Zhang, and Jed Sloan, have performed using a pendulum. Use the navigation bar to navigate to the other pages of this website, which explain pendulums, the experiment, and one has images and animations related to the topic.

		<p style="font-size:20px"><b>We are three dedicated students from Primoris Academy. This website is about an experiment that we recently did, which was to find which of the following factors affected the time of one oscillation (swing back and forth) of the pendulum: weight at the end of the pendulum, release angle, and rope length. There are results in the experiments page (just click on the button in the navigation bar). 
		Emmanuel Zhang has the paxx, Jed Sloan has the ploog, and Thomas Isernhagen has the big brain.</b></font>
